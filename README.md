# Chennai-House-Prize-Prediction

##Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Chennai using various regression models. The dataset contains details about properties, and the goal is to build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on features like location, area, and other relevant factors.

Project Structure
Chennai.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
chennai house prediction.py: Python script for preprocessing the data, building models, and evaluating their performance.
chennai house prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and visualization (if available).
Workflow Summary
Data Preprocessing:

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Location).
Removed missing values and handled outliers.
Scaled and transformed features for better model performance.
Model Training:
Trained multiple regression models, including:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Model Evaluation:
Used r2_score and visualized actual vs. predicted values for model comparison.
